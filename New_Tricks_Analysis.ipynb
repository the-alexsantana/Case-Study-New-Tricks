    "# New Tricks Data Analysis\n",
    "# ------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assignment\n",
    "# ----------\n",
    "# The attached .txt files contain client registration data collected by New Tricks, \n",
    "# a wildly popular (and fictitious) network of canine training academies located in the New York City area. \n",
    "# Their legacy registration system has limited reporting capabilities and can only export records in a very raw format. \n",
    "# The New Tricks marketing team wants to use their historical client data \n",
    "# to inform future promotional campaigns, so they've hired you to help interpret it!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives\n",
    "# ----------\n",
    "# 1. The team wants to advertise the total number of students served on the front page of their website. \n",
    "# They were hoping to add up the total in their legacy exports but weren't sure how to work with the format. \n",
    "# It also looked like the same students were sometimes showing up more than once. Please provide the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a) Calculate the total number of canine students.\n",
    "# b) Describe how you dealt with the format of the files.\n",
    "# c) Explain how you arrived at the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Next, the team is looking to kick off a campaign promoting the newly reduced rate for their Gold-level course package. \n",
    "# They want to reach out to the owners of all students who have recently registered for a Gold-Level package to see \n",
    "# if they'd be interested in being featured in the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Please use the information in the exports to create a list of all of the students who have registered for a Gold Package since 1 January 2019. \n",
    "# They just need to know the students' unique ID numbers so they can look up their contact info in the system. \n",
    "# You can attach the list in any format.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. New Tricks also wants to grow the size of their mixed breed client base. \n",
    "# To that end, they'd like to know which branch areas are seeing the least amount of mixed-breed students coming in.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Please use the information in the exports along with the zip code region ranges table to \n",
    "# determine which two regions have the smallest percentage of registrations by students classified in the system as \"Mixed/Other\". \n",
    "# They'd also like to know what methods you used to come up with the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Lastly, the team isn't entirely confident in the capabilities of their legacy system, \n",
    "# so they just want to know if you think they can trust the information in these exports. \n",
    "# Based on your work with the files, did you notice any red flags that might cause you to doubt the integrity of the data? \n",
    "# Any specific details you can provide to back your answer should help to put them at ease!\n"

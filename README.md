New Tricks, 
# a wildly popular (and fictitious) network of canine training academies located in the New York City area. 
# Their legacy registration system has limited reporting capabilities and can only export records in a very raw format. 
# The New Tricks marketing team wants to use their historical client data 
# to inform future promotional campaigns, so they've hired you to help interpret it!

# New Tricks Case Study

<strong>Scenario</strong>

- New Tricks is a fictional, wildly popular network of canine training academies located in the New York City area. Their legacy registration system has limited reporting capabilities and can only export records in a very raw format. The New Tricks marketing team wants to use their historical client data to inform future promotional campaigns, so I've been hired to interpret it.

<strong>Deliverables</strong>

- Use Python and pandas to explore and ultimately craft analysis for review.

- A Jupyter Notebook that tells a compelling story about New Tricks data.
